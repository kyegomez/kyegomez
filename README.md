I'm Kye, a 19-year-old Earthling striving to ensure the prosperity of our species, Humanity. 

I'm on a mission to help us reach a state of perpetual abundance in a post-scarcity civilization by democratizing the best AI models ever made. 🚀

I'm the leader of Agora, the open source Multi-Modality AI research organization devoted to cultivating superintelligent Multi-Modality AI. [Join our discord 😊 ](https://apac.ai/agora)

the CEO of APAC AI where we advance Humanity Multi-Modality AI. [Check out our website](https://apac.ai)

And, I'm also the leader of a vertical AI-optimized farming corporation who seeks to mass produce healthy organic food on an unimaginable scale with AI-managed facilities!

Every action I take and every thought that graces my mind is about you. 

My work is for you, to protect, guard, and defend you against the malevolent forces of chaos that threaten to disrupt our progress at every turn. 

For all things, know that I'm here for you. You are not alone.
